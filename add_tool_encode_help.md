**This tool provides examples and tools to help with encoding Limesurvey survey questions into Google Sheets. While this guide will be useful, it is most useful to practice and get a feel for how each question type is encoded. What can help familiarize you is to spend some time creating sample questions of various types and testing if you encoded them rightâ€”by activating the survey, filling out test responses, and seeing if they populate in the Google Sheets file you created.**
