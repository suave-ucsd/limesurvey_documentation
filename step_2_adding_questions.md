- We're going to begin by creating a question group, which is essentially a set of questions that will be grouped together on a single page in your survey.

Note that there must be at least one question group, since each question has to belong to a question group, but it is not required to have more than one question group.

- This is what the question group page looks like:

- Your question group does not require any of the fields to be filled in, however we recommend you at least add a title, which will help identify the question group and will show up on the top of page when the survey questions are presented.
- You can read more about question groups in the official [LimeSurvey Documentation here.](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Question_groups_-_introduction)
- When done configuring your question group, make sure you press the green "Save" button in the top right.
- Next, add a question by clicking "Add Question" in the left navigation bar, or by clicking "Save and add question" in the top right
  - To view questions and question groups in the left navigation bar, you will have to select the "Structure" option at the top of the navigation bar.

- Next, we will setup the survey questions in order to collect the data that we'll present in SuAVE.

Survey questions are very versatile and are able to handle many data formats, including but not limited to: multiple choice selections, images, and free form text.

- You can read more about setting up questions in the official [LimeSurvey Documentation here](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Questions_-_introduction).
- Once you have configured your question, ensure you save it by pressing the green "Save" button in the top right.

### Collecting Question Codes

- Each question has a question code that is either user defined or automatically assigned, which we will need in order to funnel the data into SuAVE. In this step, we're going to collect those question codes.

- In the left navigation bar select the "Settings" toggle in the top left and click "Question list."

  - Write down a list of the question codes of the questions that contain information that you would like to display in SuAVE. We will need these for the following step.

### Activate Survey

- When you are done configuring your survey, you will need to activate it in order for it to be open to responses.

- In the toolbar at the top of the page there will be a green button titled "Activate Survey" which will take you through the activation steps.
