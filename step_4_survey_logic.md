## Part 4 (Optional) - Survey Logic

Survey Logic is a high level concept that manipulates the survey in a way that certain questions are only available based on answers to previous questions. If you are not familiar with this, then this may not be the best idea, unless it is very basic.

If you want to apply survey logic to your survey, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the question where the survey logic will be applied to
2. Under "Tools", go to "Condition designer"
3. Here, you are able to reference previous questions or participant attribtue under "Questions", set an operator under "Operator" (such as equal to), and what the criteria is for the current question to display to the survey participant under "Answer"
  - For example, show question_10 if question_2 equals 2.
4. Click "Save" at the end at the top right.

You must do this process for every question you want survey logic on.
