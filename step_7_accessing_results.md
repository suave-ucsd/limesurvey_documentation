Once you have sent out your survey via a survey registration form or personalized link—responses to your survey will start coming in. Sometimes, the Google Sheets form will not automatically update to include all responses. To manually, update the Google Sheets with responses, go to [https://limesurvey.sdsc.edu/limesurvey-update](https://limesurvey.sdsc.edu/limesurvey-update). You will be prompted for a username (**lsadmin**) and a password (**VocalMimic**). Next, enter your 6-digit survey identifier and click “Update”. Once the little gray box that says that everything has updated properly pops up, all responses should now be available in the Google Sheets.
